### Java Virtual Machine
#### What is Java Virtual Machine?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a engine that provides runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It converts Java bytecode into machines language. JVM is a part of Java Run Environment (JRE). In other programming languages, the compiler produces machine code for a particular system. However, Java compiler produces code for a Virtual Machine known as Java Virtual Machine.

- JVM is the one that actually calls the main method present in a java code. 

Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java enabled system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of JVM.

When we compile a .java file, .class files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler. This .class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM.

#### How JVM works?
- First, Java code is complied into bytecode. This bytecode gets interpreted on different machines
- Between host system and Java source, Bytecode is an intermediary language.
- JVM is responsible for allocating memory space.

#### JVM Architecture
It contains classloader, memory area, execution engine etc.
